          <p>
            I remember it like it was yesterday: I was lying in bed, my heart
            racing like I had just run a marathon — but I hadn’t even moved.
            Chest tight, mind spinning, breath shallow. It was 2AM and once
            again, sleep was nowhere near. Just anxiety. Night after night.
            Month after month. That was my reality. I wasn’t sick, but I felt
            broken from the inside out.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anxiety isn’t just being nervous or stressed. It’s waking up in
            fight-or-flight mode when there’s no real danger around. It’s living
            with that constant feeling that something is about to fall apart —
            and often, that something feels like you. And for many men, this
            isn’t random — it’s part of a bigger pattern. We grow up believing
            we have to be the strong ones, the fixers, the providers. Showing
            weakness? That never made it into the script.
          </p>

          <p>
            What if I told you that this idea of constant strength is a trap?
            That always being available, always holding it together, always
            solving everyone else’s problems… isn’t sustainable? And worse —
            what happens when we try to live up to that impossible standard and
            fail, like any human would? What's left is guilt, fear of letting
            people down, and the terrifying thought that maybe, if we’re not
            producing or fixing or delivering, we’re not even useful anymore.
            Why were we taught that our value depends on what we can give — and
            not on who we are?
          </p>

          <p>
            It took me way too long to realize that asking for help isn’t
            weakness — it’s courage. Courage to admit that we're tired, lost,
            hurting. Therapy changed my life, not overnight, but slowly and
            deeply. I redefined what it means to be useful. I learned that my
            worth isn’t tied to what I do, but to what I am: a flawed, imperfect
            human being who still deserves care.
          </p>

          <p>
            Characters like Travis Bickle from *Taxi Driver* and Tyler Durden
            from *Fight Club* are powerful portraits of men adrift — lonely,
            angry, and searching for meaning in their existence. Travis, a
            Vietnam veteran drowning in the alienation of New York City, sees
            vigilantism as an escape from his emptiness; Tyler outright rejects
            consumerist society and creates, through violence, a twisted
            religion of destruction to feel alive.Both become villains — shaped
            not by fate, but by the absence of guidance, belonging, and
            emotional support. Society didn’t teach them how to be whole, only
            how to break.
          </p>

          <p>
            They represent what happens when men are left alone — truly alone —
            without support, understanding, or healthy spaces to belong. When
            that happens, we seek meaning wherever we can find it, often in
            radical ideologies, extremist movements, or narratives that glorify
            pain and domination. The rise of right-wing masculinist rhetoric
            seems to follow this logic: offering identity, purpose, and a false
            sense of brotherhood to those who feel invisible. Meanwhile, the
            left, despite focusing on important issues, has often failed to
            recognize this silent suffering, treating it with distance or
            judgment instead of empathy and dialogue. Ignoring this crisis
            doesn’t erase it — it simply pushes more men toward the angriest,
            most resentful edges of society.
          </p>

          <p>
            If this sounds familiar, take a deep breath. You are not alone.
            Asking for help doesn’t make you less — it makes you human. And
            sometimes, that’s exactly what we need to start healing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m still here. Still trying to be useful — maybe not in the way I
            was taught. Maybe not as a provider. But as someone. For something.
            For someone. Hopefully. And maybe, just maybe... that’s enough.
