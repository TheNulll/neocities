            There’s a peculiar weight that comes with being raised to believe
            you must be the provider. The reliable one. The one who solves, who
            endures, who holds steady while the world shifts around you.
            Strength isn’t optional — it’s the default. You don’t grow up
            learning to ask for help. Not out of pride necessarily, but because
            no one teaches you how. There’s simply no space for vulnerability in
            the script handed to us. You patch your own leaks, swallow your
            fears, and keep moving. Be useful. Be needed. Or quietly become
            invisible.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a while, this bargain made sense. Being needed was survival. But
            something shifted. The world — rightfully — opened its doors to
            female empowerment, autonomy, self-sufficiency. But while women
            stepped out of their predefined roles, no one ever came back to
            untie men from theirs. No one told us, “You can stop proving your
            worth through productivity now.” Our usefulness became optional. And
            optional, over time, starts to feel like... disposable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women — at least from where I stand — are no longer raised with the
            same expectation of servitude. Not fully. Not like before. And good
            for them. But the same wasn’t offered to men. The expectation of
            provision still clings to us like old code that no one bothered to
            debug. Our worth remains tethered to output — economic, physical,
            emotional. You are what you can provide. If you can’t — or won’t —
            then what are you?
          </p>
          <p>
            And when that foundation cracks, something dark creeps in. Some men
            drift toward corners of the internet built on resentment — incels,
            the manosphere, algorithmic echo chambers. Others retreat into rigid
            ideologies that promise to restore order, discipline, certainty —
            the rise of modern reactionary politics feeds on this hunger.
            Because these spaces, as toxic as they can be, offer something the
            broader culture often withholds: clarity. Direction. A sense that
            being a man still means *something*. Without that? You drift. Toward
            anger. Toward numbness. Toward an isolation you start mistaking for
            independence. You become your own island. Not out of choice — but
            out of survival.
          </p>

          <p>
            And so, you do the only thing you were ever taught: solve it
            yourself. Build. Work. Produce. Provide — even if no one asked you
            to. Even if there’s no one to receive it. You keep moving, because
            stopping feels like death. Because stopping forces you to face that
            maybe — just maybe — you’ve been running on the wrong script this
            entire time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me longer than I like to admit to realize that isolation
            doesn’t heal itself. That no amount of “fix it alone” will patch the
            hole loneliness leaves. And that’s why I’m here now — swimming
            against the current the only way I know how. Looking for help.
            Therapy. Guidance. Not because it feels natural — it doesn’t.
            Everything in me screams to keep pretending I’m fine. But I know
            where that road leads. I’ve seen it. I’ve felt it. This fight — the
            one against the creeping silence, against becoming obsolete — it
            doesn’t get won alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m still standing. Still trying to be useful — maybe not in the
            ways I was taught. Maybe not as a provider. But as someone. For
            something. Hopefully. And maybe, just maybe, that’s enough.
